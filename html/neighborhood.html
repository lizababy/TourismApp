                        <h5>Vatican City & the Prati</h5>
                        <p>Vatican City is technically a sovereign state, although in practice it is
                            just another part of Rome. The Vatican Museums, St. Peter’s, and the Vatican 
                            Gardens take up most of the land area, and the popes have lived here for
                            6 centuries. The neighborhood north of the Vatican—called “Borgo Pio”—contains
                            some good hotels (and several bad ones), but it is removed from the more happening 
                            scene of ancient and Renaissance Rome and getting to and from those areas can be 
                            time-consuming. Borgo Pio is also rather dull at night and contains few, if any, 
                            of Rome’s finest restaurants. The white-collar Prati district, a middle-class 
                            suburb just east of the Vatican, is possibly a better choice, thanks to its
                            smattering of affordable hotels, its shopping streets, and the fact that it 
                            boasts some excellent places to eat.</p>
                   
                    
                        <h5>Centro Storico & the Pantheon</h5>
                        <p>One of the most desirable (and busiest) areas of Rome, the Centro Storico
                            (“Historic Center”) is a maze of narrow streets and cobbled alleys dating 
                            from the Middle Ages, and filled with churches and palaces built during 
                            the Renaissance and baroque eras. The only way to explore it is on foot.
                            Its heart is Piazza Navona, built over Emperor Domitian’s stadium and 
                            bustling with sidewalk cafes, palazzi, street artists, musicians, and 
                            pickpockets.</p>
                    
                        <h5>Ancient Rome, Monti & Celio</h5>
                        <p>Although no longer the heart of the city, this is where Rome began,
                            with the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Roman Forum, Imperial Forums, and 
                            Circus Maximus. This area offers only a few hotels—most of them 
                            inexpensive to moderate in price—and not a lot of great restaurants.
                            Many restaurant owners have their eyes on the cash register and the 
                            tour-bus crowd, whose passengers are often herded in and out of these 
                            restaurants so fast that they don’t know whether the food is any good.
                            Just beyond the Circus Maximus is the Aventine Hill, south of the Palatine
                            and close to the Tiber, now a leafy and rather posh residential quarter—with 
                            great city views. You will get much more of a neighborhood feel if you stay in
                            Monti (Rome’s oldest rione, or quarter) or Celio. Both also have good dining, 
                            aimed at locals as well as visitors, 
                            and Monti, especially, has plenty of life from aperitivo o’clock and into
                            the wee hours of the nightptd>
