            <h3>Visitor Information</h3>
            <p>Information, Internet, maps, and the Roma Pass are available at “Tourist Information Points” 
                maintained by Roma Capitale (www.turismoroma.it) at various sites around the city. 
                They’re staffed daily from 9:30am to 7pm, except the one at Termini (daily 8am–7:30pm), 
                located in “Centro Diagnostico” hall (Building F) next to platform 24; there’s often a
                long line at this one, so if you’re staying near others listed here, skip Termini:
                Lungotevere Vaticano (Piazza Pia) near the Castel Sant’Angelo; Via Nazionale 183, 
                near the Palazzo delle Esposizioni; on Piazza delle Cinque Lune, near Piazza Navona; 
                on Via dei Fori Imperiali (for the Forum); at Via Santa Maria del Pianto 1, in the old 
                Ghetto district; and on Via Marco Minghetti, near Via del Corso. All phone calls for Roma Capitale 
                are directed through a centralized number: [tel] 06-060608. 
                Call daily between 9am and 9pm.</p>
            <p>On the Web, the Italian National Tourist Board sponsors the sites

            <h4>When To Go</h4>
            <p>April to June and late September to October are the best months for traveling in Italy 
                -- temperatures are usually mild and the crowds aren't quite so intense. Starting in mid-June,
                the summer rush really picks up, and from July to mid-September the country teems with visitors. 
                August is the worst month: Not only does it get uncomfortably hot, muggy, and crowded, 
                but the entire country goes on vacation at least from August 15 to the end of the month 
                -- and many Italians take off the entire month. Many hotels, restaurants, and shops are
                closed (except at the spas, beaches, and islands, which are where 70% of the Italians head).
                From late October to Easter, most attractions go on shorter winter hours or are closed for renovation. Many hotels and restaurants take a month or two off between November and February, spa and beach 
                destinations become padlocked ghost towns, and it can get much colder than you'd expect 
                (it might even snow).</p>
        
            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <h4>By Plane:-</h4>
            <p>Most flights arrive at Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci International Airport 
                ([tel] 06-65951), popularly known as Fiumicino, 30km (19 miles) 
                from the city center. (If you’re flying from other European cities, you might 
                land at Ciampino Airport, discussed below.) There is a tourist information office
                at the airport’s Terminal B, International arrivals, open daily from 9am to 6:30pm.</p>
            <h4>By Train or Bus:-</h4>
            <p>Trains and buses (including trains from the airport) arrive in the center of old Rome at 
                Stazione Termini, Piazza dei Cinquecento.
                This is the train, bus, and subway transportation hub for all Rome, and 
                it is surrounded by many hotels, especially budget ones.</p>
            <h4>By car:-</h4>
            <p>From the north, the main access route is the Autostrada del Sole (A1). 
                Called “Motorway of the Sun,” the highway links Milan with Naples via Bologna, Florence, 
                and Rome. At 754km (469 miles), it is the longest Italian autostrada and is the “spinal cord” 
                of Italy’s road network. All the autostrade join with the Grande Raccordo Anulare, a ring road
                encircling Rome, channeling traffic into the congested city. Tip: Long before you reach this road, 
                you should study a map carefully to see what part of Rome you plan to enter and mark your route accordingly.
                Route markings along the ring road tend to be confusing.</p>
