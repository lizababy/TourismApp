                <div class="desc"> The Roman Colosseum </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Colosseum</h3>
            <p> The Roman Colosseum is a testament to the 
                    architectural skills of the ancient Roman people and offers
                    insight into the culture that celebrated the gladiator games
                    at this huge entertainment arena. The first bloody fight 
                    ensued in A.D. 82, starting a tradition of battles between 
                    men and beasts in a public forum with crowds reaching 50,000.
                    Outside of the Colosseum, look out for the photo opportunity
                    beneath the Arch of Constantine, which was built in 315 to 
                    commemorate the victory of Constantine over Marcus Aurelius
                    Valerius Maxentius. To avoid lengthy lines, order tickets
                    online ahead of time -- they're good for 2 consecutive days
                    and include admission to the nearby Forum and Palatine Hill.

                <div class="desc"> The Roman Forum </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Roman Forum</h3>
            <p> In ancient Rome, the Forum was the center of city life, playing host to 
                festivals, celebrations, funerals and rituals. The city grew around this
                grassy area that was empty marshland until the 7th century B.C. The area lost
                its luster and fell to waste around the 8th century and remained that way until 
                excavations in the early 20th century. Today, you can pick up a map for
                a self-guided tour of the structures and arches or join a tour group for a
                more detailed history of the area. 
                Then climb to the top of Palatine Hill for sweeping views of the city.

            </div>
            <h3>Pantheon</h3>
            <p>  Rome's temple to the gods is remarkably intact, a great feat 
                considering that it was originally constructed in 27 B.C. and was 
                later rebuilt in the early 2nd century A.D. after fire damage. An altar
                was later added for Christian worship after the country abandoned its
                pagan gods. After the Renaissance, the Pantheon took on yet another 
                role as a designated tomb for some of the city's artists and elite 
                including the painter Raphael and former kings of Italy. 
                The Pantheon's architecture has inspired copycats around 
                the globe with its tall columns reaching toward the sky, 
                expansive interior and impressive dome with the sun shining through 
                the oculus, a 27-foot hole in the center of the rotunda.

            </div>
            <h3>Vatican City</h3>
            <p> Even though it's located in Rome, Vatican City has been an independent 
                state since 1929 with its own flag, coins and stamps. It even has its
                own militia, the Swiss Guard, which protects this state, the Pope and
                the 800 full-time citizens and visiting residents. The first impressive 
                site is St. Peter's Square itself designed by Bernini in the late 17th 
                century. As long as you're dressed appropriately (no bare shoulders or 
                shorts or skirts above the knee), you may enter St. Peter's Basilica and
                see Michelangelo's Piet√°, a stunningly beautiful and sad sculpture. 
                Continue up to the roof where you can take in the view of the large 
                square and city beyond. Also contained in the Vatican's walls, the
                Vatican Museums hold Italian masterpieces, including Michelangelo's 
                painted ceiling at the Sistine Chapel.
