            <p> Rome has been one of the world's most visited cities for the 
                past two millennia. In the Roman times, Rome was the centre 
                and the most powerful city of Western Civilization, ruling all 
                the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, England and parts of the
                Middle East. Afterwords, it became one of the most important 
                cities in Christianity, since the pope, the head of the Roman
                Catholic Church, resided and still lives in Rome. It became 
                a worldwide centre of pilgrimage, and later in the Renaissance,
                as the city became a major European capital of the arts, 
                education, philosophy and trade, it became an important 
                crossroads for bankers, artists and other people in general. 
                Later, in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the city was one 
                of the centres of the Grand Tour, when wealthy, young English
                aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman
                culture, art, philosophy and architecture. </p>
                <p>Towards the 1840s, 
                the first sort of mass-tourism began, and Rome became an
                extremely popular attraction for not only British people,
                but for people of all around the world. The number of tourists, 
                however, fell dramatically towards the 1870s, when Rome became 
                a battle-ground for revolutionaries and one of the homes of the
                Risorgimento, and remained like that except for a brief period 
                in the 1920s. </p>
                
                <p> However, since Rome escaped World War II 
                relatively unscathed, unlike Milan or Naples, it became an
                extremely popular and fashionable city in the 1950s and 60s,
                when numerous glamorous and exciting films, such as Roman
                Holiday, Ben Hur and more famously La Dolce Vita were filmed
                in the city. Numerous stars, actors, actresses and celebrities,
                such as Federico Fellini, Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and Anita
                Ekberg, lived or stayed in Rome, especially along its elegant
                and luxurious Via Veneto, where most of the chicest and grandest
                of all Roman hotels were and still are found. After a brief fall
                in the number of tourists in the 1980s (due to some terrorist 
                activity led by the Red Brigades and political scandals), 
                the city has now become one of the world's most popular tourist
                attractions.
