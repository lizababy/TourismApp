            <h2>Places to eat in Rome</h2>
        <br/>
            <p>There is no such thing as Italian food. Cuisine across Italy is 
                    so regional, in fact, that you’ll see entirely different piatti
                    (plates) from one city to the next — a variety that makes 
                    traveling and dining even more of a pleasure. Eating an area’s 
                    specialties not only connects you to the culture, it also helps 
                    ensure that you're eating fresher and more local, too.</p>

            <h3>Rome’s 6 Must-Eat Dishes</h3>  
                
                    <p>Rome, of course, is no different. Want to know what to order while in the capital 
                    city? Here are some of its most beloved dishes — and, just as importantly, where to find our 
                    favorite versions.</p>
         
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Nonna Betta</li>
                        <p>Roman artichokes are world-famous; in fact, they’ve even been given protected-origin status
                            (PGI, or Protected Geographical Indication) by the European Union. 
                            While you can find them steamed, stewed or thrown onto a pizza,
                            one of their most satisfying treatments originated in Rome’s 
                            Jewish Ghetto, where they come fried to a lighter-than-air crisp.
                            Today, you can find “Jewish-style artichokes” across Rome — but some 
                            restaurants make them far better than others.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <li>Cacio e Pepe</li>
                        <p>This pasta dish couldn’t be simpler: pecorino Romano cheese and fresh black
                            pepper are swirled with cooking water from the pasta
                            to make it creamy (and then, obviously, swirled with the pasta — cooked al dente,
                            of course — itself).</p>
                    
                    <li>Da Danilo </li>
                        <p>Another classic Roman pasta, this takes the pecorino Romano and fresh black 
                            pepper of the cacio e pepe but adds in guanciale (smoked pork jowl) and egg.
                            Nothing else is added, especially not cream or peas, which means the dish is a fresher, 
                            lighter version of the comfort food you might know from back home.</p>
                    
                    <li>Cesare al Casaletto </li>
                        <p>This is Rome’s classic “red sauce,” made from San Marzano tomatoes, guanciale, 
                            white wine and pecorino Romano. (Some spots add onion, too.) It’s the perfect 
                            stick-to-your-ribs dish, but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t one I dig into 
                            year-round.
                        </p>
                    
                    <li>Flavio al Velavevodetto </li>
                        <p>Culinary traditions stemming from cucina povera, or “peasant cuisine,” can be 
                            found across Italy. </p>
                    
                    <li>Armando al Pantheon</li>
                        <p>Wrap tender veal in prosciutto and sage, marinate it in white wine and fry it up. No wonder
                            the name “saltimbocca” means “jump in your mouth” in Roman dialect. In general, Roman restaurants do 
                            their antipasti and primi better than their secondi — but this is one meat dish to be sure to try.</p>
