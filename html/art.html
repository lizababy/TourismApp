                    in Piazza Colonna, dates from the second half of 17th century, but was rebuilt in 
                    1838, and currently houses the headquarters of Il tempo.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi</span>, located in Piazza Santi Apostoli, was owned
                    by the Colonna, Ludovisi, Chigi and Odescalchi households. In the 1660s it
                    was the subject of a significant transformation by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
                    The façade of the building is built in a Renaissance and Baroque style. 
                    The Palazzo Altieri, located between Via del Plebiscito and Piazza del Gesu, 
                    was the residence of the Altieri family.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Palazzo Colonna</span>, documented since the 12th century, occupies an entire block 
                    between Piazza Santi Apostoli, via Nazionale, via IV Novembre and Via della Pilotta.
                    It was the residence of the Colonna family, whose members descended from the Counts
                    of Tusculum. Palazzo Corsini, located in Trastevere, was built by Cardinal Neri 
                    Maria Corsini (grandson of Pope Clement XII) in the first half of the 18th century.

                <h5>Bridges</h5>
                <p>The first Roman bridges, made after the conquest of the left side of the Tiber,
                    were built in wood, so that they would be ready to be destroyed in case of enemy
                    attack. As a matter of fact, the first bridge in masonry, <span class="highlight">The Ponte Milvio</span>, was 
                    made in the 2nd century BC, and is located in the point where three major northern consular roads (the Via Flaminia, the Via Cassia and Via Clodia). The Romans gave the Tiber an almost sacred value, hence its bridges were also specially regarded, so that those who constructed them, pontefices (from pontem facere), had priestly functions (most Roman bridges were as a matter of fact built by Popes) 
                    Today there are 28 bridges crossing the Tiber in Rome, while others were built 
                    \for crossing the river Aniene.</p>

            <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>Rome has for centuries been one of the most important artistic centres in the world.</p>
            <h4>Paintings</h4>
            <p>The first Roman indigenous art forms, at the stage of the origins 
                and the First Republic, were pretty basic and not very refined.
                With the contact with Greek civilization, Rome would have an 
                ambivalent attitude towards the "superior" Greek art: appreciate 
                its gradual forms, and will try contempt for authors, artists 
                socially inferior Greeks against Roman conquerors (the same attitude 
                was taken towards Greek philosophers and poets). Over the centuries
                Greek art will have a growing appreciation, although
                there are trends indigenous "anti-classic" that will be an element of continuity with the Romanesque style.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>The Roman Renaissance was also arguably one of the most important styles
                in Roman artistic history. The Renaissance period changed Rome's face 
                dramatically, with works like <span class="highlight">the Pietà by Michelangelo </span> and <span class="highlight">the frescoes 
                    of the Borgia Apartment</span>, all made during Innocent's reign. Rome reached 
                the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II (1503–1513) and his
                successors Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family. 
                In this twenty-years period Rome became one of the greatest centres 
                of art in the world. The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio,
                Perugino, Botticelli and Bramante, who built the temple of San Pietro
                in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican. Raphael,
                who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy creating frescos 
                in the Cappella Niccolina, the Villa Farnesina, the Raphael's Rooms, plus many
                other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of 
                the <span class="highlight"> Sistine Chapel </span> and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb 
                of Julius. Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly
                a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, 
                parties, intrigues and licentious episodes. The city's had a fruitful and 
                thriving economy, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including 
                Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts.
                Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, 
                second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities 
                and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice. The city was affected 
                greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists 
                and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and 
                Cortona, to name a few. In the late-18th century and early-19th 
                century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour,
                when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats 
                visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, 
                philosophy and architecture. Rome hosted a great number of 
                neoclassical and rococo artists, such as <span class="highlight">Pannini</span>
                and <span class="highlight"> Bernardo Bellotto</span>.
                Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes and museums.
                Rome boasts numerous painters and artists, and as a worldwide artistic centre, 
                numerous artists have visited or resided in the city. Examples include
                Bramante, (1444–1514), Raphael (1483–1520), Perugino (1450–1523),
                Michelangelo (1475–1564), Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71),
                Caravaggio (1571–1610), Bernini (1598–1680), 
                Carlo Maderno (1556–1629), Rubens (1577–1640), Angelica Kauffman (1741–1807),
                Antonio Canova (1757–1821) and Dane Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770–1844).
            </p>
            <h4>Music and the Performing Arts</h4>
            <p>The city is also an important centre for music, and it has an intense
                and thriving performing arts scene, including several prestigious music
                conservatories and theatres. It hosts the <span class="highlight"> Accademia Nazionale di </span>
                Santa Cecilia (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have
                been built in the new Parco della Musica, one of the largest musical 
                venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di 
                Roma, as well as several minor musical institutions.
                The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and 
                the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004.</p>
